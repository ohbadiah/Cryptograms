This is intended to, when complete, be a reasonable implementation of this 
assignment: 

http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cis554-2011/Assignments/scala-01-cryptograms.html

in two languages: Haskell and Scala. I am doing this because I took a class on Haskell and I want to become more familiar with Scala. I also think comparing the two languages is a lot of fun.
